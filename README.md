# Netflix Movie Duration Analysis
This project analyzes the relationship between movie release years and their durations using a Netflix dataset. 
The primary goal is to explore whether movies are getting shorter over time. The analysis focuses on movies from the dataset, excluding TV shows, 
and visualizes the trend through a scatter plot.

# Key Insights:
    Duration and release year correlation.
    Genre-based color-coding for easier visual comparison.
    Exploration of trends over time with a "maybe" conclusion regarding decreasing movie lengths.

# Tools Used:
    Python (for data analysis and visualization)
    Pandas (for data manipulation)
    Matplotlib (for creating the scatter plot)

# Objective:
Visualize the duration of Netflix movies by release year.
Analyze if there is a trend towards shorter movies over time.
Highlight genre-based insights using color-coding.

# Conclusion:
The analysis suggests a possible trend of shorter movie durations over time, but the results are inconclusive, with significant variability in movie lengths across different years and genres. The findings highlight the complexity of content trends and point to the need for deeper exploration into other factors influencing movie durations on streaming platforms like Netflix.
